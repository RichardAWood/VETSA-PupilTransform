VETSA's pupilometer exports data in a block format, making it impossible to analyze with standard
statistical programs (SAS, etc.)

This VBA macro asks the user to specify a file containing raw pupilometry data, parses through the 
the file, determines whether each block is for the Pupil Light Reflex (PLR) or Digit Span test, 
and adds the necessary information into the appropiate worksheet.

To run, paste the code into an Excel Module (I always use Module 1, but it doesn't matter), and it 
will show up in the View->Macros window.

Assumes that the workbook containing the macro has worksheets named "PLR" and "Digit Span",
and that these worksheets have a header row already in place.
